homework:

blue or maybe green...

1229904000 from file lp1.rb

characters and/or spaces enclosed in quotes

single quotes don't work with interpolation
  they are not interchangeable in that a single can not be used to close a double and vice versa

"how do you use a 'quote mark' inside a string" "how\'d you use a quote mark inside a string"

a name assigned to reference a value

name = gets.chomp  puts "Hello "+name+"!"   puts "Hello #{name}!"

to_s converts item to string, to_i converts item to integer

evens:

variable.method

rand(20)+1

def new_method optional_param
  method do stuff here maybe with optional_param
end

def new_method (opt_param1,opt_param2)
  method actions 
end

you get a wrong number of arguments error(ArgumentError)

it is a different variable local to the method

the value outside the method is the same as it was last assigned outside of the method

the last expression that was evaluated
