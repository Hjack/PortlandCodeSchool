What is recursion?
  "Recursion in computer science is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem" 
  --from my understanding its a combination of a function calling itself and breaking a problem down to its smallest repeatable factor so that repetitive calling of the same funtction can be used to solve the larger problem.
When learning recursion, what is the defacto “hello world” style program?
    Factorials
Use pseudo code to complete a recursive sort
  
Hint: There are three steps to any recursive algorithm
Check to see if there’s any work left to do and return if not. (early return)
Do some work (reduce the problem)
Call yourself (recurse) (sometimes 2 & 3 are the same step)
Evens:

How do you redirect the output of a program to a file?
 ruby filename.rb > file_saved_to.txt
How do you open and read the contents of a file?
  File.read filename
How do you open and write text to a file?
  File.open filename, 'w' do |f| f.write object_you_want_to_write end
How do you put a variable inside a string? (Interpolation)
  "string just going along and BAM a #{variable} is interpolated"
What does YAML stand for?
  I read that it's now known as "Yaml aint markup language"(gotta recurse ya know)
How do you convert an object to YAML and then convert it back to an object? (Marshal/Serialize)
  .to_yaml and YAML::load
How do you do a recursive search for files when using Dir (Globbing)
  Fir['**/*.fileinfo']
